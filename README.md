# Groundwater Flow Modeling By Excel
Excel sheets to solve steady-state groundwater flow for a variety of cases.
The solution of the groundwater flow equation has been implemented using Excel sheets for the following conceptual models:
- Flow in the horizontal plane in a confined aquifer of known transmissivities
- Flow in the horizontal plane in an unconfined aquifer of known hydraulic conductivities
- Flow in a vertical cross-section of an unconfined aquifer with calculation of the phreatic surface

The first case is described in the paper by Gómez-Hernandez (2022) and the second and third ones in the paper currently under revision by Gómez-Hernández and Secci (2023)

The subfolders with flopy scripts contain Python scripts and input files to replicate the Excel model using MODFLOW with the flopy library on the Python environment. They can be used to verify the accuracy of the spreadsheet results
